# Dashboard with real-time information about Warsaw real estate market

[Link to the App](https://warsaw-flats.herokuapp.com/)

Before putting this dashboard together I scraped ads 
from a real estate website since January 2021. 
Data will be updated on a weekly basis so that 
the user can track an average price per square 
metre in a district and flat size of his/her interest.

Aggregated data I am sharing --> [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbalcerzak/warsaw_flats_api/main/json_dir/flats.json)
